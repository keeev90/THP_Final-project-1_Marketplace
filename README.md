## Pitch of the project

This website was created as a training project for final projects, two-weeks projects marking the conclusion of 12 weeks of intensive code learning.

The Pitch is simple:

> Two entrepreneurs have contacted your group to realize your first freelance mission. Your goal is to create a website that will sell pictures of kittens.

> The store will be simple: a user comes on the site and is welcomed by an index of the items for sale. He can see a detailed view of these products, and add them to his cart after registration. From this cart, he can order the wanted picture(s) and pay via Stripe. He will receive the products by email, and the administrator will receive an email informing him that a sale was made.

The Hacking project is an intensive tech bootcamp that works without teacher nor school. The strength of THP is its community. Indeed, THP relies on peer-learning to pass on skills and knowledges. To know more, click on the link on the banner.
